Project Description:
Student Database Management System
We use databases in every aspect of our lives today. Data stored on servers 
around the world amounts to trillions of bytes. Such a database can be accessed 
using SQL, one of the most basic methods. But have you ever thought about using 
C++ to maintain such a database? In this project, we will talk about implementing 
different views on a text file according to the type of user and edit accordingly. 
The system will be designed using object-oriented principles and will leverage 
technologies such as C++, MySQL, etc. The system will also include robust 
security features to ensure that student data is kept safe and secure.
Technologies Required: C++ programming language, Relational Database
Management System (RDBMS), Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), Data
Structures, Multi-threading, and Encryption/Decryption.
